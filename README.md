# <em>Extracurricular Projects</em>
Some apps I've made for fun but also for learning purposes.

## Jogo da Memoria:
Matching game I've adapted from [a Microsoft tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/tutorial-3-create-a-matching-game?view=vs-2019) to WPF.


## Poligonos
Little drawing app I've made. You can draw polygons, give them color, change background color, invert colors and delete polygons individually or all at once.
